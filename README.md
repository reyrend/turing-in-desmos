# turing-in-desmos
this repository contains a python program to creating turing mashines in desmos. Also it contains instruction to use
## How to use
### Working in program
check wikipedia to understand what a Turing machine is.
this program can work with alphabet = \[\_, 0, 1\]. enlarging the alphabet is too long and difficult
To create rules for machine, run program.py and describe every condition. you need to enter 3 characters: what to replace, which way to go, and which state to switch to. enter "<" to go left, ">" to go right and "\_" to stay. To erase cell enter -1. To stop mashine enter state n + 1, where n is count of states.
Then copy all code and paste in desmos. If you get error "parse error: double subscript" just erase and write any character in all equations.

you can do anything in graph field.
1. carriage.
2. cell selection. It turns red if it goes outside the array.
3. number
4. button to set 0 in the selected cell
5. button to set 1 in the selected cell
6. button to start simulating (turns into pause button)
7. reset the array.
8. point to move carriage.
